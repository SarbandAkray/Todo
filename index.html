            My name is Sarband welcome to my website, let me tell you a little bit of my life:
            when I was a teenager I always used to be amazed by tech whether it be a small matchine that people put in thier pockets that helps them to do their daily tasks or
            a computer that could bring imagination into reality I always wanted to know how these small and amazing pecies of tech actually work and why are they
            diffrent in sizes and funcionalaties and why they could do some stuff but couldnt do some other stuff?? I had those question and alot more but when I got into it and
            started searching for answers, I was amazed by how doing something as simple as showing a text on a screen rquires alot of work to be done in the background just to show that 
            peace of text and how far the tech came to much such a problem easier by just writing a couple lines of code to make it show the text that you want, and the possibilites of 
            stuff that you can do with tech is just like a infinte ocean there is no limits thats why I practice every day to expand my knowledge and get my imagination into reality.
